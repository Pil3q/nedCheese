Poor Ned has to pay for the cheese in euros and He is tired of customers calling him and asking 'how much cheese I can get today' so thanks to [API](https://openexchangerates.org/) the amount updates every hour. Unfortunately the api does not allow poor students to change base currency so all the exchanges are going through the USD, but the rate is good so you are safe cheese lovers",
